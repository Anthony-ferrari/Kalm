What is Kalm?

- Kalm is an extension that brings you a randomized variety of meditation videos from guided to mindful meditation in only 3 clicks. 

Why Kalm?

- Kalm is for anyone looking to take a quick break from their daily lives and looking forward to getting back into their routine.

How does it work? 

- After adding our extension, click on the extension labeled by a letter "K" then on the "Meditate" button. After selecting which video you would like to watch, press on the play button in the middle of the video or click the "Link to Video" button to be redirected to the YouTube video in the YouTube platform.

- The videos lengths are randomized from 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 minute sessions. The session lengths are long enough for you to enjoy, but short enough for you to stay on task. The video content is also randomized so that you get a variety of content to pick from with every click. 

Goals of Kalm:

• Increased Focus
• Reduced Anxiety
• Elevated Happiness

Stay Kalm with us!
